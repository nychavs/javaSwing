# Wordle

<h2>Hi! Just trying to do a letreco or a termoo.o game </h2>
Some instrutions for you about the game:
<p>- so, there are four text fields, one for each letter </p>
<p>- There are more five rows, which each one represents a try </p>
<p>- when you type a letter and fill all the fields of one row, some 
things will happen: </p>

<ul>
<li>Green color: Congrats! you've answered the right letter in the 
right positions </li>
<li>Brown color: Hmm... almost correct, you've answered the right 
letter but in the wrong position</li>
<li>Red color: Oh no! you've answered the wrong letter /p>
</ul>
